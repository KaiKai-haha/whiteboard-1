Why I Used Java:
I chose to implement the solution in Java because I am currently in a semester where we're learning Java as part of my coursework. Although we've only covered part of the Java course so far, I will be continuing with more advanced Java topics after my internship in the next semester. By solving this problem using Java, I aim to strengthen my understanding of the concepts we've already learned and prepare myself for the upcoming advanced topics. My goal is to become proficient in Java by the time I complete my course.
